    <h2>This is a fan-site dedicated to Players and Lovers of the instant Classic Video Game Left 4 Dead 2.</h2>
	
	<p>Left 4 Dead 2 (abbreviated as L4D2) is a cooperative first-person shooter video game and the sequel to Valve
	Corporation's award-winning Left 4 Dead. The game launched on November 17, 2009, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 
	360 in the United States and November 20 in Europe; in 2010, Left 4 Dead 2 was made available to the Steam client 
	for Mac OS X. It builds upon the cooperatively-focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same 
	game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 
	focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit 
	zombie-like tendencies. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses 
	that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale. The gameplay is procedurally altered 
	by the "AI Director 2.0", which monitors the players' performance and adjusts the scenario to provide a dynamic 
	challenge. Other new features include new types of Special Infected and melee weapons.</p>
	
	<p>The game made its world premiere at E3 2009 with a trailer during the Microsoft press event. Prior to release, 
	it received a combination of positive and negative critical and community reactions. It attracted an unusually high 
	volume of pre-release controversy about the game's graphic content. In response, alterations were made to the cover 
	art and both Australia (due to having no R18+ rating at the time) and Germany refused to rate the unmodified edition.
	After release however, the game was met with positive reviews.</p>

		<h4>Dead Center</h4>
  	
	
	
	<p> <img src="images/deadcenter.jpg" alt="deadcenter"/>In Savannah, Georgia where the four Survivors find themselves abandoned on a hotel roof by rescue helicopters. 
	  They decide to head for the local mall, where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. After a brief encounter 
	  with a gun store owner, Whitaker (voiced by Dayton Callie), the Survivors discover that the mall is overrun, with  
	  all CEDA agents having become either dead or infected as well. Ellis helps the group use a stock car to bust out 
	  of the mall and travel towards New Orleans, rumored to be the last standing city in America. </p>

	<h4>Dark Carnival</h4>
	
	
	<p> <img src="images/DarkCarnival.jpg" alt="Dark Carnival"/>
	The four survivors find the highway ahead completely blocked by ditched vehicles, and are forced to travel on foot through an 
	abandoned (but still-operating) amusement park. There, Coach devises a plan to use a large-scale light show used by a rock 
	band, The Midnight Riders, in order to signal a helicopter pilot for rescue.</p>

	<h4>Swamp Fever</h4> 
	
	 
    <p> <img src="images/swamp_fever.jpg" alt="Swamp Fever"/>After being rescued, they discover their pilot to be infected. Nick is forced to kill him (echoing a similar situation 
    in Left 4 Dead), causing the chopper to crash into a bayou, the setting for Swamp Fever. They find brief shelter near a plantation
    mansion and make radio contact with Virgil, a Cajun boat captain who can assist them, but begins to run low on diesel fuel on 
    the way to New Orleans.</p>

<div class="container">
	<h4>Hard Rain</h4>
    
   
    <p> <img src="images/hardrain.jpg" alt="Hard Rain"/> As a tremulous rainstorm approaches the Survivors go ashore at an unnamed riverside town in Mississippi; make their way 
    through an abandoned (and Witch-infested sugarcane mill to a gas station to get diesel fuel, and return to signal Virgil with 
    an improvised "flare".</p>

<div class="container">
	<h4>The Parish</h4>
	
   
    
    <p> <img src="images/theparish.jpg" alt="The Parish"/> In the final campaign, The Parish, Virgil drops the group off at New Orleans, where the military appears to be evacuating 
    civilians across a bridge. On the way there, the four discover the city overrun with Infected, and that the military is actually 
    leaving the city before it is destroyed by an air strike. The group manages to reach the bridge, where they make contact with the military. Judging from their dialog, the military pilots suspect the Survivors to be "carriers",
    similar to the original Survivors of Left 4 Dead. After securing their rescue helicopter, the Survivors lower and cross 
    the bridge, escaping on the helicopter just as the bridge is destroyed. While the Survivors' fate is left unclear after this 
    point, Chet Faliszek, the game's writer, said that the military is taking survivors to cruise ships in an attempt to escape 
    the worldwide infection.</p>
